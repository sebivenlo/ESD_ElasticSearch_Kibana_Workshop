1. Welcome to this short setup. We are going to download the images for elastic and kibana.

The setup folder has a windows sub-directory for windows users and another for macOS or linux based systems.


You can run these scripts for an easy setup. FIRST SETUP ELASTIC ONLY THEN SETUP KIBANA.
Elastic is done around when the login tokens are diplayed
If you prefer to run the commands yourself you can go to:
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/run-elasticsearch-locally.html#_send_requests_to_elasticsearch
or ofcourse open the scripts with an editor and copy from there.



When the containers of both elastic AND kibana have been started, keep their commandline/terminal windows open, you will need these!

Read this part only if error!
(If you encounter any errors in this step go to:
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html

if you have the error about vm.max_map_count go to that source and scroll down or read the bottom of this file.

)



-----------------
2. Go to localhost:5601. Enter the elastic enrolment token there. (the address shown in the terminal doesn't always work)
this enrolment token is generated by the elastic container the first time you set it up. You might have to scroll up in the elastic window

Then a code is generated in the KIBANA terminal, go to that one and put that in.


3. at this stage you have to login. Enter the generated pasword, again from the elastic container terminal. The username is "elastic" 

4.you are in! done











if you have errors:
go to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html


vm.max_map_count is mentioned in that source, but for ease it's listed below aswell:



Linux

To view the current value for the vm.max_map_count setting, run:

grep vm.max_map_count /etc/sysctl.conf
vm.max_map_count=262144


To apply the setting on a live system, run:

sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144


--------
macOS with Docker for Mac:

From the command line, run:

screen ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/vms/0/tty


--------
Windows and macOS with Docker Desktop:

The vm.max_map_count setting must be set via docker-machine:

docker-machine ssh
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
--------



( most windows users have this i think)

Windows with Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend :
The vm.max_map_count setting must be set in the docker-desktop container:

wsl -d docker-desktop
sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
